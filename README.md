# Constitution

## Intent Of This Repository
The intent of this repository is to host a wiki (click "Wiki" above) that contains the sections and paragraphs of a Constitution-like document.

## Overview
The Constitution provides the guidelines for the operation of a participatory democracy. 
The principle feature is that representatives are drafted to serve for short terms to decide well-defined questions.
This is similar to "jury duty". The difference is that the questions are legislative questions rather than judicial trials.
The principle output of a legislature is an annual budget. 
So the procedure guidelines documented in this Constitution are initially focused on how to make the budget-preparation process ameanable to "jury" decision-making.
